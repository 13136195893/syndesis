# Update scripts

The directories within this directory contain the various update scripts.

`<version>`::
  Use this for updating to a specific version. As the version number are not synces between upstream and product, these kind of directories **should not** be used.
any::
  In the `any` directory you place scripts which are run for _every_ update. These scripts have to be _idempotent_ in that sense that they have to check the status of the system and only change/update something if this has not already happened. That way these scripts can run all the time without doing any harm when they are run a second time.

IMPORTANT: Please use only the "any/" directory and put idempotent files into it. Also, you script should not depend on any particular order (also you can order them), but if so, clearly indicate which other script needs to be run before the current script is run within the comments of this script.
