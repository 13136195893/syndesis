[[Json-CamelJsoncomponent]]

== Camel JSON component

The *json:* component will silently marshal payloads to JSON using the Jackson library provided that:

* there is no `Content-Type` header set on the `in` message
* the payload isn't already an InputStream, Reader, String, byte[] or ByteBuffer and look like JSON already (e.g. start and ends with quotes or `{` and `}` or `[` and `]`

This ensures that we can JSON-ize invocations of connectors so that we tend to send JSON to functions unless there's another explicit content type used.
