= Overview of extension content and structure

An extension is a collection of classes, dependencies and resources 
that are packaged as a JAR file, which is structured as follows:

[source]
----
extension.jar
|
+- META-INF
|  |
|  +- syndesis
|     |
|     +- syndesis-extension-definition.json <1>
|
+- mycompany
|  |
|  +-project
|    |
|    +-YourClasses.class <2>
|
+- lib <3>
  |
  +-dependency1.jar
  |
  +-dependency2.jar
----
<1> Extension definition
<2> Extension classes
<3> Additional dependencies

[WARNING]
====
{prodname} uses Spring Boot to load an extension. Consequently, you must
package an extension according to Spring Boot's executable JAR format. 
For example, ensure that you use the `ZipEntry.STORED()` method to save
a nested JAR file.
