## GitHub Labels

We use GitHub labels in order to categorize epics, issues and tasks.
They are the foundation of our process, so please use labels for issues.


Labels themselves are also grouped.
Each label consists of two part:
A *Group* and a *Name* which are separated by a slash (`/`).
For example the label `module/ui` is used to mark issue which are relevant to the Syndesis UI module.

We distinguish the following groups:

[cols="1,5",options="header"]
|===
| Group
| Description

| **cat**
| Misc categories which are can be added freely

| **prio**
| Priority of the issue. Only one `prio/` label must be added per issue
