## syndesis deploy

With `syndesis deploy` you can deploy Syndesis to an arbitrary OpenShift cluster.
You have to be connected to the cluster with `oc login` for this command to work.
It's an alternative to `syndesis minishift` but does not support a Development workflow.

You have to provide the route name with `--route`, how the project in the given cluster can be reached. E.g. `--route app-proj186023.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com`.
By default this commands installs in the currently connected project, but you can specify an alternative project with `--project <project>`.
If this project already exists, it gets deleted unconditionally.
