= About implementing integrations that connect to SAP Concur

To develop and test integrations that connect to SAP Concur, 
access the SAP Concur implementation site. When the integration
is working as expected, export it and then import it to a 
{prodname} production site. The general procedure
for implementing integrations is described below. 

It is assumed that there are two {prodname} environments: one for development
and one for production. 

.Procedure Overview

. A system administrator does the following:

.. Obtain credentials and URLs for access to the SAP Concur implementation site. 
.. In the {prodname} development environment:  
... On the *Settings* page, configure the SAP Concur connector with
SAP Concur implementation site credentials and URLs. 
... Create a SAP Concur connection.
.. Tell a business user that a SAP Concur connection to the SAP Concur
implementation site is available. 

. In the {prodname} development environment, a business user can then:
.. Create an integration and add a SAP Concur connection to the integration. 
.. Publish the integration. 
.. Trigger execution of the integration. 
.. Check the SAP Concur implementation site to determine if the action was
successful. 
.. When the integration is running as expected, export it from {prodname}. 

. A system administrator can then:
.. Obtain credentials and URLs for access to the SAP Concur production site. 
.. Import the integration into a {prodname} production environment.
.. In the {prodname} production environment: 
... Configure the SAP Concur connector with SAP Concur production site
credentials. 
... Create a SAP Concur connection. 
.. Tell a business user that a SAP Concur connection to the SAP Concur
production site is available.

. In the {prodname} production environment, a business user can then: 
.. Edit the imported integration to replace its SAP Concur connection with 
a SAP Concur connection that is configured to access the SAP Concur 
production site.
.. Publish the integration. 
.. Trigger execution of the integration. 
.. Check the SAP Concur production site to determine if the action was
successful.
