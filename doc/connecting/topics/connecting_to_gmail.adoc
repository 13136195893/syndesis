= Connecting to Gmail

To trigger an integration when a particular Gmail
account receives a message, add a Gmail connection to an integration as its
start connection. To send a message from a
particular Gmail account, add a Gmail connection as the integration's
finish connection, or as a middle connection. 

The steps for connecting to Gmail in an integration are:

. Authorize {prodname} to access the Gmail API.
. Create a Gmail connection and grant authorization for access to particular
Gmail account. 
. Add a Gmail connection to an integration.
