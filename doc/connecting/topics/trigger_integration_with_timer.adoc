= Triggering integration execution with a timer

:context: timer

To trigger execution of an integration according to a schedule that
you specify, add a timer connection as an integration's start
connection. {prodname} provides a timer connection, which you can use
to start as many integrations as you like. You do not need to create
a timer connection unless you inadvertently delete the provided
timer connection. See the following topics:

* <<add-timer-connection_{context}>>
* <<create-timer-connection_{context}>>
