= Connecting to Slack

As a business user, you can create an integration that connects to Slack. A 
connection to Slack can do either one of the following:

* Trigger execution of the integration when a channel that you specify
receives a message. The integration passes the message to the next
step in the integration.

* Deliver a message to a particular user or to a channel. For example, this is
useful when an integration downloads a file from an FTP server and 
processes it in some way. You can finish an integration by 
notifying a Slack channel or user that the process was successful.

To connect to Slack in an integration, create a Slack 
connection and then add the connection to an integration.
