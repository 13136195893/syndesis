= General procedure for using the {prodname} webhook

To trigger execution of an integration with an HTTP `GET` or `POST`
request, you must do the following:

. Decide whether you want to send a `GET` or `POST` request to {prodname}. 
. Plan your integration to handle this request. 
. Create a Webhook connection. 
. Create any other connections that you want to add to the integration. 
. Create the integration:
.. Add the Webhook connection as the start connection.
.. Add the finish connection and then any other connections that are
required in the integration. 
+
For a `GET` request, be sure to add a connection to the application that
contains the data you want to obtain. For a `POST` request, add a connection
to the application whose data you want to update. 

.. Add a data mapper step after the Webhook connection. 
Map the parameter fields in the HTTP request to the data fields in the next connection. 
.. Add any other steps that the integration needs.
. Publish the integration and wait for it to be *Running*. 
. Go to the integration summary page and copy the external URL that 
{prodname} provides. 
. Modify this external URL to construct your `GET` or `PULL` request. 
. Implement the application that sends the HTTP `GET` or `POST` request 
to {prodname}.
