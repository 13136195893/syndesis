= Creating a connection to an OData server

In an integration, to obtain entities from an OData server, 
or to update, create or delete
entities on an OData server, you must first create a connection to 
that OData server.

.Prerequisite

* You must know the base URL for the OData server that you want
to connect to. 
* If that server uses authentication then you must have the 
required credentials, and, if required, an SSL certificate. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to
display any available connections.
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
connectors.  
. Click the *OData* connector.
. To configure the connection:
.. In the *Service Root URL* field, enter the base URL for the 
OData service that you want to access. 
.. In the *User Name* field, if the server uses basic authentication, 
then enter your user name.
.. In the *Password* field, if the server uses basic authentication, 
then enter your password. 
.. In the *Server Certificate* field, paste the content of an SSL 
certificate. 

. Click *Next*.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, you might enter `OData North`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. 
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the connection you 
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would 
see that *OData North* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration. 

.Next step
Add your OData connection to an integration.
