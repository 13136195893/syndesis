= Register {prodname} as a Gmail client application

To be able to connect to Gmail in an integration, 
you must register your installation of {prodname} as a client application
that can access Gmail. Registration authorizes {prodname} to access Gmail
and lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Gmail. While each Gmail connection uses the same registration, 
each connection can use different user credentials to access a different
Gmail account. 

To authorize your {prodname} installation to access Gmail:

. In {prodname}, in the left navigation panel, click *Settings*. 
. On the *Settings* page, near the top, click *Copy Callback URL* to
copy the callback URL for your installation of {prodname} to the clipboard. 
You will need this URL toward the end of this procedure. 
. In another browser tab, go to `https://console.developers.google.com` 
and do the following:
.. Confirm that you are signed in to a Gmail account for which you want
to authorize access from {prodname}. Or, choose a Gmail account for
which to grant authorization and sign in to that account. 
.. Ensure that you want to use the current Google project to grant
authorization to {prodname}. Or, choose or create another project. 
If this Google account does not already
have a project, you must create one. For information about Google projects
and how you might want to organize your use of projects, click the Google help
icon in the upper right. 
.. You should see the *APIs and Services* dashboard. If you do not, then
in the upper left corner, click the

*APIs and Services* > *Dashboard*. 
.. Click the *Gmail API* card.
.. In the *Gmail API* page, click *Enable*. 
.. In the page that appears, click *Create credentials*. 
.. On the *Add credentials to your project page*, do the following:

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and in the Gmail *Client ID* 
field, paste the Gmail client ID that you just copied. 

. Return to the Google developers site and to the right of the 
client secret field, click 
image:images/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client secret to
your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and in the 
Gmail *Client Secret* field, paste the Gmail client secret that you 
just copied. 
. Click *Save*. You should get a *Registration Successful!* notification.
