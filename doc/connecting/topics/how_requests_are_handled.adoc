= How {prodname} handles HTTP requests

You can specify an HTTP `GET` or `POST` request to trigger execution of
an integration. Although a `GET` request usually obtains data and a
`POST` request usually updates data, you can use either request  
to trigger an integration that does either operation. Any parameters 
in the request are available for mapping to data fields in the
next connection that is in the integration. 

To map Webhook connection data, the Webhook connection's data shape must 
adhere to a specific JSON schema. For examples, see 
<<how-to-specify-request>>. When a Webhook connection's data shape
does not conform to this JSON schema, then the integration 
can access only the data that the `POST` method provides in the HTTP body.

A Webhook connection only passes the data it receives to
the next connection in the integration. 
When {prodname} receives an HTTP request, it:

* Returns an HTTP status header to the requester. When a request successfully
triggers an integration, the {prodname} return code is `201`.
When a request fails to trigger an integration, the {prodname}
return code is `5xx`. 
* Does not return any other data to the requester.
* Passes the data in the request to the next connection in the integration. 

This means that you can define an integration that is triggered by
a `GET` request and that updates data rather than obtaining data. 
Likewise, you can define an integration that is triggered by a `POST` request and that obtains data
rather than updating data.
