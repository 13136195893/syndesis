= About testing integrations that connect to SAP Concur

Access the SAP Concur implementation site, and not the SAP Concur 
production site, when you are developing and
testing integrations that connect to SAP Concur. The general procedure
for developing and testing integrations is as follows:

. Obtain credentials and URLs for access to the SAP Concur implementation site. 
. Register your {prodname} environment with the SAP Concur implementation site.
. Create a SAP Concur connection.
. Create an integration and add a SAP Concur connection to the integration. 
. Publish the integration. 
. Trigger execution of the integration. 
. Check the SAP Concur implementation site to determine if the action was
accomplished. 
. When the integration is running as expected, export it from {prodname}. 
. Import the integration to a {prodname} environment that is registered 
with the SAP Concur production site.
