= Identify SAP Concur fields that need to be mapped

In most integrations, you need to add a data mapping step before a 
connection to SAP Concur. For each SAP Concur connection action, you
want to map one or more fields that are available in previous integration
steps to the appropriate SAP Concur action fields.

SAP Concur action fields have generic names that do not indicate content.
To determine the correct SAP Concur target field for a data mapping, see
