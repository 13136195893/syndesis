= {prodname} Sample Integration Tutorials

{prodname} lets you obtain data from an
application or service, operate on that data if you need to, and then send the
data to a completely different application or service. You can do all this
without writing code.

Explore {prodname} by creating these
sample integrations:

* <<twitter-to-salesforce>>
* <<salesforce-to-db>>
* <<amq-to-rest-api>>

In this release, one integration at a time can be running. If you have a 
running (published) integration and you create a new integration and try to 
publish it, the new integration is automatically in the *Unpublished* state. 
You must unpublish the running integration before you can publish 
(start and run) the new integration.
