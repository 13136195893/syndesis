{prodname} displays the integration summary page with an *In Progress* spinning
circle. {prodname} is generating the runtime for the integration and
will start it when the runtime is ready. This takes a few minutes.

In this technology preview, only one integration at a time can be running.
If you already created one of the other sample integrations and that
integration is running then this integration is automatically in the
*Inactive* state. You must stop the running integration before {prodname} can
start this integration.

To stop an integration:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the entry for the integration that you want to stop, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right.
. In the popup, click *Deactivate*.

After stopping an integration, start another integration as follows:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the entry for the integration that you want to start, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right.
. In the popup, click *Activate*.
