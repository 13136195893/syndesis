= Overview of extension content and structure

An extension is a collection of classes, dependencies, and resources 
that are packaged as a `.jar` file. The structure of the `.jar` file
is as follows:

[source]
----
extension.jar
|
+- META-INF
|  |
|  +- syndesis
|     |
|     +- syndesis-extension-definition.json <1>
|
+- mycompany
|  |
|  +-project
|    |
|    +-YourClasses.class <2>
|
+- lib <3>
  |
  +-dependency1.jar
  |
  +-dependency2.jar
----
<1> A JSON schema file that specifies the data structures that 
define the extension.
<2> The Java classes that implement the behavior that the extension 
provides. 
<3> Additional dependencies that are required to build and 
execute the custom feature. 

.Requirement

{prodname} uses Spring Boot to load an extension. Consequently, you must
package an extension according to Spring Boot's executable JAR format. 
For example, ensure that you use the `ZipEntry.STORED()` method to save
a nested JAR file.
