= About testing extensions

Developers should unit test an extension independently.

It is expected that you have multiple {prodname}
integration environments, including at least a development
environment and a production environment. Do your testing in the
development environment.

When testing is complete, export the integration from the development
environment and import it into the production environment. See
{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#copying-integrations-to-other-environments[{NameOfFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}].
