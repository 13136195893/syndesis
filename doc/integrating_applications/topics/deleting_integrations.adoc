= Deleting integrations

To delete an integration:

. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the list of integrations, click the entry for the integration
you want to delete.
. On the integration's summary page, click *Delete Integration*.
. In the popup, click *OK* to confirm that you want to delete the integration.

After you delete an integration, {prodname} still has the history of 
that integration. If you import a version of the deleted integration, 
then {prodname} associates the history of the deleted integration with 
the imported integration.
