want the integration to use after the start connection and before 
the finish connection. 

. On the *Choose an Action* page, click one of the following actions: 
+
* *Copy Object* to copy a file into the bucket that the connection accesses.
On the *Configure Action* page, select the checkbox if you want to delete 
the original file after it is safely in the bucket.
* *Get Object* to obtain a file from the bucket that the connection accesses.

connection accesses. To configure polling:

.. In the *Delay* field, enter the number of milliseconds that elapse between
polls. 
.. Select *Delete After Read* when you want to remove files from the bucket
after you obtain them.
.. In the *Max Messages Per Poll* field, enter the largest number of files
that one poll operation can obtain.

name of each file it obtains.
