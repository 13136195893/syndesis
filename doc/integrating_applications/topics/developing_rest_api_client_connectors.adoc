= Developing REST API client connectors

{prodname} can create connectors for
Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces
(REST APIs)
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
OpenAPI 2.0 specification that describes a REST API that you want to connect to.
If the API service provider does not make an OpenAPI specification available
then an experienced developer must create the OpenAPI specification.

The following topics provide information and instructions for developing
REST API connectors:
