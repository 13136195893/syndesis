= Publishing integrations

Publishing an integration builds and deploys the integration runtime. 
The integration is active and running. An integration can have 
exactly one version that is currently published. 

There are several ways to publish an integration:

* Create an integration and as the last step, click the *Publish*
button that appears in the upper right corner.

* If there are no currently running versions of an integration that you
want to publish:
+
. In the left {prodname} pane, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, click the entry for an integration
whose status is *Draft* or *Inactive*. 
. On the integration's summary page , click *Start Integration*.
