= Updating API client connectors

You cannot update an API client connector. If there is
an update to the API's Swagger specification, then you must upload an updated
Swagger file and create a new API client connector.

To update integrations to use connections based on the updated Swagger
specification:

. Create a new API client connector based on the updated Swagger specification.
. Create a new connection from the new connector.
. Edit the integration to remove the old connection and add the new connection.
. Publish the updated integration.
