[id='connecting-to-databases']
= Connecting to SQL databases

In an integration, you can connect to any of the following types of SQL
databases:

* Apache Derby
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Proprietary SQL database, such as Oracle

You create a connection to the database you want to access in an integration
and then you add that connection to an integration. Before you can create
a connection to a proprietary database, you must upload a JDBC driver for
that database. 

See the following topics for details:

* <<create-database-connection>>
* <<add-database-connection>>
