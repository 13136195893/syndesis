= About {prodname} connections

Before you can create an integration, you must create a connection 
to each application or service
that you want to obtain data from or send data to. To create a connection,
you select a connector and add configuration information. For example,
to create an AMQ connection, you select the AMQ connector
and then follow prompts to identify the broker to connect to and the
account to use for the connection.

To create an integraton, you select a connection to start the integration,
a connection to end the integration, and optionally one or more 
connections for accessing additional applications. 
Any number of integrations can use the same connection. 

For details, see <<connecting-to-applications>>.
