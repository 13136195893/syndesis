= Mapping data

To add a data mapper step:

. In the left panel, where you want to add a data mapper step, 
hover over the image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].
. In the popup that appears, click *Data Mapper*.
  
The data mapping page presents you with two lists of data fields - the *Sources* list and the *Target* list.

To map data, you create a link between the *Sources* data item and the *Target* data item.

There are three different types of mapping:

.Data mapping types

|===
|Mapping type  |What does it do?

|Combine
|The combine action allows you to combine a number of source fields into one target field. For example, day, month and year fields can be combined into a date field.

|Map
|The map action just maps the source field directly to the target field, with no manipulation. This is the default action.

|Separate
|The separate action allows you to separate a source field into a number of target fields. For example, a date field can be separated into day, month, year fields. 

|===

On the *Target* data field, you can specify a *Transformation*, which 
specifies how the data in the target field is stored.
