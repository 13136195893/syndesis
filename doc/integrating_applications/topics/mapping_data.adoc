= Mapping data

The data mapping page will present you with two lists of data fields - the *Sources* list and the *Target* list.

To map data, you create a link between the *Sources* data item and the *Target* data item.

There are three different types of mapping:

.Data mapping types

|===
|Mapping type  |What does it do?

|Combine
|The combine action allows you to combine a number of Source fields into one Target field. For example, day, month and year fields can be combined into a date field.

|Map
|The map action just maps the Source field directly to the Target field, with no manipulation. This is the default action.

|Separate
|The Separate action allows you to separate a Source field into a number of Target fields. For example, a date field can be separated into day, month, year fields. 

|===

On the *Target* data field you can specify a *Transformation*, which will specify how the data in the target field will be stored.
