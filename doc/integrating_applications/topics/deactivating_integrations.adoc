= Deactivating integrations

Each integration can have exactly one active version. If there is a
running version of an integration, this is the active version. To stop 
running an integration, you deactivate it. 

To deactivate a running integration: 

. In the left {prodname} pane, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, click the entry for the integration you
want to stop running. The status of this integration must be *Active*. 
. On the integration's summary page , click *Stop Integration*.
