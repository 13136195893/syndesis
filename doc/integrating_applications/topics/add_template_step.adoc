= Adding a template step

A template step allows data to be reshaped into a single consistent
format, by providing a pattern of text with substitutable symbols. Specific
data values are mapped to those symbols and populated at runtime.

The template step has specific requirements for both its data input and output:
* both input and output requires data to be in the form of a JSON object.
* the symbols specified in the template must have data values mapped to them in
  order for data to populate them.
* once the data has been shaped into the template format, the output value is
  stored in a single 'message' attribute. This attribute must be mapped to the
  next step or connection.
* mapping is performed in both cases using the data mapping step (see
  <<add-data-mapping-step>>).

The template needs to be specified and the step allows this to either be
created from scratch or loaded from a file. The currently supported syntax
for the template is https://mustache.github.io[Mustache], with
https://velocity.apache.org[Velocity] and
https://freemarker.apache.org[Freemarker] are excepted to be added at a later
date.

To add a template step, you must be creating a new integration or
editing an integration. Due to the input and output specification requirements
the integration must already have its start and finish connections.

To add a template step:

. In the integration visualization panel on the left, hover over the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign]
at the location where you want to add a log step.
. In the popup, click *Add a Step*.
. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Template*.
. On the *Upload Template* page, select *Upload a file* or *create*
  a template. The former displays a button for choosing a
  local template file (requires a .tmpl extension) while the latter choice
  displays the template editor.

+
The editor only allows valid syntax so the *Done* button will be disabled
should the syntax be invalid.

. When the template step configuration is complete, click *Done* to add the
  step to the integration.
. The connections or steps either side of the template step will require
data mapping:
* Insert a data mapping step prior to the template step. This will allow you
  to map values in the preceding connection data to the symbols entered into
  the template.
* Insert a data mapping step after the the template step. The generated
  template/data combination is placed into a *message* attribute hence this
  should be mapped to whatever preferred attribute of the target connection.
. When the integration is complete, it can be published and output data will
  appear formatted according to the syntax rules stipulated by the template.
