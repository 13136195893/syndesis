= Making custom steps available

To upload an extension to {prodname}:

. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Customizations*.
. At the top, click the *Extensions* tab.
. Click *Import Extension*.
. Choose the `.jar` file that contains the extension that you want to upload.
A developer needs to make this file available to you.
{prodname} immediately tries to validate that the file contains an
extension. If there is a problem, {prodname} displays a message about the error.
You will need to coordinate with the extension
developer to obtain an updated `.jar` file, which you can then try to upload.
+
If {prodname} validates the file, it extracts and displays the extension's
name, ID, and description. It also lists the custom steps that the
extension defines.
. Review the extension details.
. Click *Import*. {prodname} makes the custom step(s) available and displays
the extension details page.
