= Add an advanced filter step

In a filter step, {prodname} inspects the
data and continues the integration only if the content meets
criteria that you define. The advanced filter step lets you specify
a filter expression if the basic filter step does not let you 
define the exact filter you need. 

Add all connections to your integration before you add any steps. When you 
add a step, {prodname} operates on the data it receives from the
previous connection or the previous step. 

When you add a step you might be creating a new integration or editing
an integration. The flow of the integration appears in the left panel. 

To add an advanced filter step:

. In the left panel, where you want to add an advanced filter step to
the integration, hover over the 
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign']
and in the popup that appears, click *Add a Step*. 

. Select *Advanced Filter*.

. In the edit box, use the Camel Simple language to specify a filter
expression. To learn about the Camel Simple language,
see http://camel.apache.org/simple.html.

. Click *Done*.
