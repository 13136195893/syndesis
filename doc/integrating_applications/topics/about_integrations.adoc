= About integrations

To set up data integration between applications, you create an integration.
An integration is set of ordered steps. This set includes:

* A step that connects to the application that is the
source of the data.

* A step that connects to the application that receives the data and
finishes the integration.

* Optional additional steps that connect to applications
between the start and finish
connections. An additional connection can obtain other data.

* Optional steps that operate on data between connections to
applications. Typically,
there is a step that maps data fields from the previous connection to
data fields that the next connection uses.
