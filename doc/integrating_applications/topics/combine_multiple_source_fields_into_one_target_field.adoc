= Combining multiple source fields into one target field

In a data mapper step, you can combine multiple source fields into one 
compound target field. For example, you can map the `FirstName` and `LastName` 
fields to the `CustomerName` field.

.Prerequisite
For the target field, you must know what type of content is in each
part of this compound field, the order and index of each part of the content, 
and the separator between parts, such as a space or comma. See
<<example-missing-unwanted-data>>. 

.Procedure

. In the *Target* panel, click the field into which you want to map more 
than one source field.

. In the *Sources* panel, click the first field that you want to combine
into the target field.

. In the *Sources* panel, for the each of the other fields that you want to 
combine into the target field, hover over that field, and press 
*CTRL-Mouse1* (*CMD-Mouse1* on MacOS).
+
The data mapper automatically changes the field action from *Map* to *Combine*. 
+
When you are done you should see a line from each of the source fields to
the target field. 

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Separator* field, accept or select the 
character that the data mapper inserts in the target field between the content
from different source fields. The default is a space.

. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Sources*, ensure that the source
fields are in the same order as the corresponding content in the
compound target field. 
+
If necessary, drag and drop source fields to achieve the same order. 
The data mapper automatically updates the index numbers to reflect the 
new order. 

. If you mapped a source field to each part of the compound target field,
then skip to the last step.
+
If the target field expects data that is not available to be mapped, then in the 
*Mapping Details* panel, edit the index of each 
source field so that it is the same as the index of the corresponding data
in the compound target field. The data mapper automatically adds 
padding fields as needed to indicate missing data. 
+
If you accidentally create too many padding fields, click the trash-can 
icon on each extra padding field to delete it.  

. To confirm that the mapping is correctly defined, in the upper right, click

this step. A mapping that combines the values of more than one source field
into one target field looks like this:
