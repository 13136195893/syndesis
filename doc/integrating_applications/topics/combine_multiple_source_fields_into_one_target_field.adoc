== Combine multiple source fields into one target field

You can combine more than one source field into a single target field using the *Combine* mapping.

When you use a *Combine* mapping, you will be asked to specify a *Separator*. The separator is the character that will be placed between the fields when they are combined into one field.

To add a *Combine* mapping :

. Click on the field you want to combine the source fields into from the Target list. 

. In the *Data Mapping* pane, place the cursor in the *Source* box. Start overtyping *[none]* with the name of the source field. As you type the field name will be offered up in a dropdown. Select the field name.

. Select *Combine* and a *Separator* 

. To add another field click *Add Source*.
