= Republishing older integration versions

You might publish an integration that does not work the way you want it to.
In this situation, you can stop the incorrect version
and replace it with a version that you published previously and that
runs correctly.

To republish an older integration version:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations* to display a list of the 
the integrations in this environment. 
. Click the entry for the integration that is not working correctly.
. On the *Integration Summary* page, click *History* to display
the versions of this integration. 
. In the entry for the version that is running, at the far right, click 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab] and select 
*Unpublish*.
. Click *OK* to confirm that you want to stop running this version. 
. Wait for *Unpublished* to appear to the right of the integration name near
the top of the page.
. In the entry for the integration version that you want to start
running again, at the far right, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab]
and select *Publish*. 
. Click *OK* to confirm that you want to publish this version of the
integration. 

{prodname} publishes
this version, which takes a few minutes. When the republished version
is running, then *Published version _n_* appears to the right
of the integration's name.
