= Republishing older integration versions

You might publish an integration that does not work the way you want it to.
In this situation, you can deactivate (stop) the incorrect version
and replace it with a version that you published previously and that
runs correctly.

To republish an older integration version:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations* to display a list of the 
the integrations in this environment. 
. Click the entry for the *Active* integration that is not working correctly. 
. In the integration's summary page, click *Stop Integration*. 
. When this version is in the *Undeployed* state, in the *History* section, 
click the 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab] to the right of the
version you want to republish. 
. In the popup menu, click *Publish*. {prodname} builds and deploys
this version, which takes a few minutes. When the republished version
is running, then its state is *Active*.
