= Adding steps between connections

After you add connections to an integration, you can optionally add
steps between connections. Each step operates on data obtained from the
previous connection(s) and any other previous steps and makes the data
available to the next step in the integration. 

Add all connections to your integration before you add additional steps. 

In an integration, additional steps are optional. Add them if you need to
operate on data between connections.
