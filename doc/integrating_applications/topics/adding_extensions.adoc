= Adding extensions

{prodname} provides a number of steps for operating on 
integration data between connections. If {prodname} does not provide a 
step that you need,
a developer can code an extension that defines one or more
custom steps. The developer gives you a `.jar` file that contains the extension.
You then upload the extension in {prodname} to make the custom step(s)
available for use in integrations. The following topics provide details:

* <<how-tooling-items-map>>
* <<making-extensions-available>> 
* <<managing-extensions>>

For an example of uploading and using an extension, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/7.0-tp/html-single/ignite_sample_integration_tutorials/#amq-to-rest-api[AMQ to REST API sample integration tutorial].

Information about coding the extension and creating the `.jar` file is
