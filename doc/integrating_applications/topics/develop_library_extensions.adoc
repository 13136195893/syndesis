= How to develop library extensions

A library extension provides a resource that an 
integration requires at runtime. A library extension does not contribute steps or 
connectors to {prodname}. 

Support for library extensions is evolving. In this release:

* You cannot select which library extension(s) an 
integration should include. For more information, see 
https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/issues/2808[this GitHub issue].

* When you add a database connection to an integration, 
{prodname} adds all extensions that 
have the `jdbc-driver` tag to the integration runtime. For more information, see 
https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/issues/2809[this GitHub issue].
