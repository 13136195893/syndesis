= Adding an AMQ or AMQP connection to an integration

You must create an AMQ or AMQP connection before you can add an
AMQ or AMQP connection to an
integration. If you did not already create an AMQ or AMQP connection,
see <<create-amq-connection>>.

The procedure for adding an AMQ or AMQP connection to an integration varies
according to whether you are adding the connection as the
start connection, the finish connection, or a middle connection.
