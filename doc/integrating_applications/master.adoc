= Integrating Applications with {prodname}

This guide provides information and instructions for using
{prodname}'s web interface to integrate applications.

The content in this guide is organized as follows:

* <<understanding>>
* <<logging-in-and-out>>
* <<connecting-to-applications>>
* <<creating-integrations>>
* <<mapping-data>>
* <<adding-customizations>>
* <<managing-integrations>>

To learn how to use {prodname} by creating sample integrations, see:
{LinkIgniteTutorials}[{NameOfIgniteTutorials}].

In this release, one integration at a time can be running. If you have a 
running (published) integration and you create a new integration and try to 
publish it, the new integration is automatically in the *Unpublished* state. 
You must unpublish the running integration before you can publish 
(start and run) the new integration.
