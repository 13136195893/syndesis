= Adding a split step

In a flow, when a connection returns a collection of objects, 
{prodname} executes subsequent steps once for the collection.
If you want to execute subsequent steps once for each object 
that is in the collection, add a split step. For example, a
Google Sheets connection returns a collection of row objects.
To execute subsequent steps once for each row, add a 
split step after the Google Sheets connection.
