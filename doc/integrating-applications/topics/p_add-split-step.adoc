= Adding a split step

During execution of a flow, when a connection returns a collection of objects, 
{prodname} executes subsequent steps once for the collection.
If you want to execute subsequent steps once for each object 
that is in the collection, add a split step. For example, a
Google Sheets connection returns a collection of row objects.
To execute subsequent steps once for each row, add a 
split step after the Google Sheets connection. 

.Prerequisites
* You are creating or editing a flow.
* The flow already has all the connections that it requires.

.Procedure

. In the visualization panel on the left, where you want to 
add a split step to the flow, click the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].

. Click *Split*. This step does not require any configuration. 

.Additional information 

Typically, you want to add any split steps and aggregate steps 
before you add data mapper steps. This is because 
whether the data is a collection or individual objects affects
the mappings. If you add a data mapper step and then add a split 
step, you usually need to redo the mappings. Likewise, if you 
remove a split or aggregate step, then you would need to redo
any mappings. 

If there is nothing to split, the flow continues to process the
single object as if the split step were not in the flow.
