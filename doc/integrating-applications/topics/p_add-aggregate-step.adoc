Instead of executing subsequent steps once for each object, {prodname} 
executes subsequent steps once for the collection. 

.Prerequisites
* You are creating or editing a flow.
* The flow already has all the connections that it requires.
* A previous step split a collection into individual objects. 

.Procedure

. In the flow visualization panel on the left, where you want to 
add an aggregate step to the flow, click the
