= Using the data mapper to process collections

In a flow, when a step outputs a collection and when the 
next connection expects a collection as the input, you can 
use the data mapper to specify how you want the flow to 
process the collection.  You just need to map fields in 
the source collection to fields in the target collection. 

The data mapper displays 
image:images/collection-icon.png[this icon], to indicate
a collection. Expand the collection container to see the
fields that are in each element that is in the collection. 
When you map fields in a source collection to
fields in a target collection, when {prodname} executes
the flow, it iterates over the source collection to  
populate each element in the target collection 
according to how you mapped the fields. 

Mapping a source collection to a target collections looks
like this:
